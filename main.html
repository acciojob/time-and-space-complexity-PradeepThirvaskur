	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how efficiently an algorithm solves a problem. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run in relation to its input size. An efficient algorithm is one that provides a low time complexity, ensuring that it can handle large inputs quickly and effectively.

        Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It describes how much additional memory an algorithm needs to run based on its input size. In Big O notation, space complexity is denoted as <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the input size. Optimizing space complexity is essential in scenarios where memory is limited, making it important to find a balance between efficient memory usage and algorithm performance.
